# Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #7 Transpose a 4×4 Matrix

🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge demonstrates how to transpose a matrix.
The program first fills a 4×4 matrix with ordered numbers, then generates a new matrix where rows become columns.

Matrix transposition is a core concept in linear algebra and computer science.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Understanding matrix orientation (rows vs columns)
- Implementing matrix transposition
- Swapping indices in 2D arrays
- Separating matrix construction from transformation
- Writing clean, modular C++ code

🧩 Core Algorithm Concept
-
Matrix transposition works by swapping indices:
Original[i][j] → Transposed[j][i]

This represents a geometric transformation of data,
changing its orientation without changing its values.
